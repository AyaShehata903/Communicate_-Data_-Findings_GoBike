# Ford GoBike System Dataset Investigation
## by Aya Tarek


## Dataset

> There are 183412 GoBike trip in the dataset with 16 features to describe the trip:
> * an ID number for each bicycle
> * how long it was rented for, in seconds
> * the beginning and end staton ID, latitude, longitude and station name
> * the start and end time
> * the year the user was born
> * the gender of the user
> * whether the user has a subscription to the service or not

## Summary of Findings

> The distribution of the trip duration is skewed to the right (positively skewed), indicates that the majority of the trips are less than 20 minutes long.
> The distance traveled distribution a right-skew (positive skew) to shorter rides.
> The majority of the Users are males.
> The majority of the Users are subscribers, at 91%.
> The Age distribution of the users  shows a right-skew (positive skew) to the range between 20 years and 40 years.
> There is no observed relation between the distance and duration ,  But it is obvious  that the most of the rides with 1km distance takes 10m duration.
> The Customer users spend more duration than the Subscriber users.
> Both male an female has the same Duration range the is different from the other gender.
> The oldest riders had the greatest fluctuation between the shorest and longest duration .
> The oldest riders had the greatest fluctuation between the shorest and longest rides .
> The Majority of the male users are subscribers. 
> The Majority of the users are Subscribers with positive relationship between the Distance and the Duration.
> The Majority of the users are between 20 and 40 years old with positive relationship between the Distance and the Duration.
> "other gender" category had the most outliers in the data, as well as ages over 50 years.
## Key Insights for Presentation

> The distribution of the trip duration is skewed to the right (positively skewed), indicates that the majority of the trips are less than 20 minutes long.
> It was very interset to discovre that customers spends more duration than the subscribers, But if you think of it as the customers don't usually going on bike trips as a result they spend more time, unlike the subscribers who going on bike trips more often, it seems more sense. However, it was surprising to see that customers, on average, take longer duration than subscribers.
> Most of the Users are Subscribers with positive relationship between the Distance and the Duration, thought this positive relation wasn't observed in the Bivariate exploration. Most of the age of users is between 20 and 40 years old with positive relation between Distance and the Duration.
